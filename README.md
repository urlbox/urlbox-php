# Urlbox/Screenshots

## Capture highly accurate webpage screenshots of any site using Urlbox.io in PHP

This package uses the [Urlbox.io](https://urlbox.io) screenshot as a service to generate website screenshots.

## Installation

This package can be installed through Composer.

```bash
composer require urlbox/screenshots
```

When using Laravel, if you are using a version pre v5.5 you will need to include the Service Provider manually:

```php
// app/config/app.php

'providers' => [
    '...',
    'Urlbox\Screenshots\UrlboxProvider'
];
```

setup your API keys:

```php
// config/services.php

'urlbox' => [
    'key'    => env('URLBOX_KEY'),
    'secret' => env('URLBOX_SECRET')
];
```

and in your .env file:

```bash
# URLBOX
URLBOX_KEY=YOUR_URLBOX_KEY
URLBOX_SECRET=YOUR_URLBOX_SECRET
```

## Usage

You will need a [Urlbox](https://urlbox.io) account to use this package. Please signup [here](https://urlbox.io/pricing) and get your API Key and Secret from the Urlbox dashboard once you have logged in.

Here is a sample call to generate a Urlbox screenshot URL:

```php
    use Urlbox\Screenshots\Urlbox;
    $urlbox = Urlbox::fromCredentials('API_KEY', 'API_SECRET');
    // only required option is a url:
    $options['url'] = 'example.com';
    // specify any other options to augment the screenshot...
    $options['width'] = 1280;
    $options['height'] = 1024;
    // Create the Urlbox URL
    $urlboxUrl = $urlbox->generateUrl($options);
    // $urlboxUrl is now 'https://api.urlbox.io/v1/API_KEY/TOKEN/png?url=example.com'
    // Generate a screenshot by loading the Urlbox URL in an img tag:
    echo '<img src="'.$urlboxUrl.'" alt="Test screenshot generated by Urlbox">'
```

If you're using Laravel and have setup the service provider, you can use the Facade provided:

```php
use Urlbox\Screenshots\Facades\Urlbox;

$options["url"] = "example.com";
$urlboxUrl = Urlbox::generateUrl($options);
// $urlboxUrl is now 'https://api.urlbox.io/v1/API_KEY/TOKEN/png?url=example.com'
```

You can now use the result (`$urlboxUrl`) by placing it inside an `<img/>` tag as the `src` parameter.

When you load the image, a screenshot of example.com will be returned.

The following options can be passed to the generateUrl method:
