# Urlbox/Screenshots

## Capture highly accurate webpage screenshots of any site using Urlbox.com in PHP

This package uses the [Urlbox.com](https://urlbox.com) screenshot as a service to generate website screenshots.

## Installation

This package can be installed through Composer.

```bash
composer require urlbox/screenshots
```


### Laravel Setup

When using Laravel, if you are using a version pre v5.5 you will need to include the Service Provider manually:

```php
// app/config/app.php

'providers' => [
    // ...
    'Urlbox\Screenshots\UrlboxProvider'
];
```

Setup your API keys:

```php
// config/services.php

'urlbox' => [
    'key'    => env('URLBOX_KEY'),
    'secret' => env('URLBOX_SECRET'),
    'webhook_secret' => env('URLBOX_WEBHOOK_SECRET'),
];
```

and in your .env file:

```bash
# URLBOX
URLBOX_KEY=YOUR_URLBOX_KEY
URLBOX_SECRET=YOUR_URLBOX_SECRET
URLBOX_WEBHOOK_SECRET=YOUR_URLBOX_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

You can find your API Credentials and Webhook Secret [here](https://www.urlbox.com/dashboard/projects)

## Usage

You will need a [Urlbox](https:// account to use this package. Please signup [here](https://urlbox.com/pricing) and get your API Key and Secret from the Urlbox dashboard once you have logged in.

Here is a sample call to generate a Urlbox screenshot URL:

```php
    use Urlbox\Screenshots\Urlbox;
    $urlbox = Urlbox::fromCredentials( 'API_KEY', 'API_SECRET' );
    
    $options = [
        // only required option is a url:
        'url' => 'example.com',
        
        // specify any other options to augment the screenshot...
        'width' => 1280,
        'height' => 1024,
    ];
    
    // Create the Urlbox URL
    $urlboxUrl = $urlbox->generateSignedUrl( $options );
    // $urlboxUrl is now 'https://api.urlbox.com/v1/API_KEY/TOKEN/png?url=example.com'
    
    // Generate a screenshot by loading the Urlbox URL in an img tag:
    echo '<img src="' . $urlboxUrl . '" alt="Test screenshot generated by Urlbox">'
```

If you're using Laravel and have set up the service provider, you can use the Facade provided:

```php
use Urlbox\Screenshots\Facades\Urlbox;

$options = [ 'url' => 'example.com' ];
$urlboxUrl = Urlbox::generateUrl( $options );
// $urlboxUrl is now 'https://api.urlbox.com/v1/API_KEY/TOKEN/png?url=example.com'
```

You can now use the result (`$urlboxUrl`) by placing it inside an `<img/>` tag as the `src` parameter.

When you load the image, a screenshot of example.com will be returned.

## Options
